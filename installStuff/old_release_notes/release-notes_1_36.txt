A new release of PC Repair Tracker is attached to this email. 

# Touchscreen Enhancements
Serveral Enhancements have been made to the touchscreen view. You can now switch between various canned items with one less click, you
can change the status of a computer from the touchscreen. A selector was also added to view any of the statuses in addition to the 
buttons at the top for the most common working statuses.

# New Main Menus
In an effort to waste less space at the top of the screen, the toolbar at the top has been replaced with a stationary drop down menu in the
upper left hand corner.

#Signature Pad Enhancements:
Signature pads are now available on all customer printables. They can be enabled and disabled per document type and even if 
they are enabled, it can be hidden per document.

#Color Themes
Several new default flat color themes for the main background have been added. Also 2 alternative stylesheets have been made available.

# Service Reminders
This is one of the features I am excited about. I hope that it is feature that will be used to bring customers back
for regular service. You can now define several things such as tuneups, anti-virus renewals, etc and add them to a PC
and the system will prompt you to email these out to your users. I also plan on putting a discount in my own service
reminders to encourage customers to bring their computers back in for service. 

#Print Multiple Invoices & Receipts
You can now print ranges of invoices and receipts by number up to 200 at one time.

#New Work Order email and sms notifications 
You can now check a box to send an email and/or sms notification to a PCRT user when checking in a system.

# Service Request Module
A new module is now available to add to your website for taking service requests. It has some spam control features where you
can limit the number of submissions in a time period by IP. You can also add an optional CAPTCHA. You can assigna PCRT user to 
receive a notification of a submission via email and SMS. The CAPTCHA feature will probably be something you want to enable
if you have SMS enabled and spamming becomes a problem.

# New Bluepay/Stripe Payment Plugins
The Bluepay plugin was created for a PCRT/Bluepay user. The new Stripe payments plugin looks to be a nice option for people
that do not like monthly fees. Also does not require a merchant account. At a glance it appears to be US/Canada only. 
 

To UPGRADE, make sure you follow the directions IN ORDER in the update.txt file.
