>>>>>>>>>> Change Log

Feature: Switched Database functions to use the mysqli extension. The old mysql extension is scheduled to be depreciated as of PHP 7
Feature: Lots of work on Deposits: 
	You can now attach deposits to invoices on a work order. 
	They can be moved back and forth between the work order and other invoices on the work order.
	You can remove a deposit from a work order which would free it up to apply to a different work order. 
	Balances will show on the invoice and on the work order screen on open invoices.
	You can take a previously "un-attached" deposit, and attach it to a work order, and move it to a work order invoice if you wish.
	You can add a deposit to an invoice from the open invoice viewer, regardless if the invoice is attached to a work order.
	The deposit total and balances now show on the open invoice viewer. 
	You can attach un-attached deposits to invoices not attached to work orders.

Enhancement: Invoice, Receipt, Deposit Receipt display enhancements
Bug Fix: Fixed bug where contact information is not passed from group invoice list to checkout cart.
Feature: Invoices can now be directly attached to a group contact without being attached to a work order. 
	Invoices started from the group viewer invoice link 
	or the search and pick on the current customer when a group is selected from the search result will attach to the group.

Feature: Show invoice totals on the group viewer.
Enhancements: Links to Group from Invoice List Viewer
Feature: Service Reminders can now be set to recurring.
Feature: Recurring Work Orders. You can now create a recurring task that will generate a work order on an existing asset. You can create them from an
	existing work order, or add them to assets that are part of Service Contracts from the Contract Viewer.
Feature: Stripe Users: Invoices will now have a link for customers to pay their invoices via Stripe. 
	This was kind of a quick hack, you will still need to record the payment.
Change: The link to "Ready to Sell" was moved to the top of the POS Categories and can now be browsed by asset type.
        It also shows "cost" values for Assets designated as a saleable asset for inventory valuation purposes.
Feature: New report "Payment Detail Report". Allows you to pull a report from a specified date range by payment type.
Feature: Open invoice statement. You can now print or email a listing of unpaid invoices, complete with deposit balance information.
Feature: Support for the Square Credit Card processor, this does not support the reader, but you can use it with your Square account.
Enhancement: You can now edit the store setting on invoices and recurring invoices in multistore.

Note: The above new features have been added to the mobile interface as well. Features below are only in the Desktop Version.

Enhancements: Lots of Visual Enhancements.
Enhancement: A color swatch picker and the ability to save color swatches for the Store Color theme in the Store Admin.
Feature: On the Asset list on the group viewer, you can now mass add new assets. Just specify the customer name, asset/device make, asset type and optional notes.
Enhancement: On the recent work order list and work order browser, it now shows receipt and invoice totals, and if a work order is attached to a service contract,
             it will show the contract. Just one more way to make sure work orders are getting billed.
Feature: 1-Click backup and upload of your database to Dropbox.
Feature: Browsers for both Recurring Work Orders, and Service Reminders
Enhancement: Auto Refresh of status list every 2 minutes, notifications every minute.

                Deposits, Service Contracts, Sticky Notes
Enhancement: Revamped Check-in Screen. It now searches your existing Assets/Devices on the fly to make sure you do not enter a duplicate.
