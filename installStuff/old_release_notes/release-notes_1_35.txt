group. You can view the list of recurring invoices from the invoice viewer. When creating a recurring invoice, you can set an Invoiced Thru Date which represents the date
the services are billed through, and a "terms" value which represents the number of days prior to the Invoice Thru date that the invoice will be created. You can also choose a 
invoicing frequency of 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year. When invoices are ready to be created a notice will appear at the top of the status boxes.
When creating invoices, you can choose which invoices to process. You can choose whether to email them, print them or both. When multiple invoices are selected for printing
it will print them in one shot, doing a page break at the end of each invoice.
