A new release of PC Repair Tracker is attached to this email.

Whats NEW: 

# Version Number: First off, after seeing some people call the last release 1.4, 1.40 or 1.04, I've decided to move away from decimal point version numbers
to whole numbers, in case you were wondering why this release is being called v2 

# More configurable statuses. You now have greater control on what info is shown in the status list, and you can reorder statuses.

# UI Work: Alot of work has been done to improve the UI for the desktop version of PCRT.

# Service Contracts: A new area has been added to the asset group area to specify service contracts.

# Stored Credit Cards: You can now store credit cards for charging later using Stripe, Paypal or AuthorizeNet
