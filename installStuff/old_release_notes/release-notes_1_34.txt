A new release of PC Repair Tracker is attached to this email. 

# Updates to Touchscreen View:
The code for the icons in the touchscreen view was re-written and new devices were added.

# Counting Inventory
A new tool was added to help recount inventory. It can be found by clicking on "Inventory Tools" when clicking on "Inventory"
It constists of two tools, a system to scan and count items, and a system to show you items that have positive stock counts 
but did not get counted yet. In my own store of around 1500 items I was able to count everything in less than 2 hours. I used
a wheeled cart with a netbook a scan gun. Google Chrome works best as it automatically hilights the stock count so that you 
can type the new count or just hit enter if the number is the same.

#Serials and Product Codes:
You can now enter serial numbers and product codes on inventoried and non-inventoried items. If an item from inventory is added to
the cart and it was stocked with a number it will automatically redirect and allow you pick the number from a list. 

# Attachments
You can now add attachments to PC's, Work Orders, and Groups.

#Tech Docs
A common practice in alot of shops is to print out fixes found on the Internet. You can use a third party tool like PDF creator 
and save them as PDF, and upload them to the Tech Docs section.

# SMS Canned Responses 
You can now define mulitple canned SMS responses.

# ICS Export
You can now export the calendar as ics. This also works with syncing to (but not from) Google calendar. The links to download or sync can
be found in the settings menu. You must login as admin and generate a hash to use this feature the first time. The hash is to allow an
external system to access it and still provide some security.

#Signed Claim Ticket text.
A user brought up the fact that if a claim ticked is signed, that the version of those terms and conditions must be saved at that time
so that if the text is changed what was signed off on does not. This now happens.


To UPGRADE, make sure you follow the directions IN ORDER in the update.txt file.
