A new release of PC Repair Tracker is attached to this email. Due to the addition of utf8 support and translations,
almost every file in PCRT has had modifications done. 

Whats NEW: 

# Translations & UTF-8
PCRT is now easily translatable and supports utf-8 encoding. This was a very large task, there may still be a few strings that were missed or other 
tweaks that are needed. For those that already speak English, this feature will allow you to tweak or rename just about every string in the interface.  

# Checkout/Collection Receipt
For those that like a checkout receipt to prove that a customer has picked up/collected an item, it is now available.

# Set Work Order Status on Checkout:
If you are processing a receipt, you can choose which status a work order switches to.

# Search
The search feature has been rewritten and much more user friendly for both the store and repair.

# Dymo Labels
Dymo labels can now be previewed and printed inline without opening the dymo software. You can also now save templates right in the PCRT interface.

# Price Markups
Basic controls were added to calculate price markups.

# Work Order Notes
Work order notes have been rewritten to allow timestamps and multiple note entries
 
# d7 Integration
Thanks to some awesome collaboration with Nick from d7, you can now easily transfer reports via FTP to PCRT! This feature requires d7 version
9.6 our newer. I am sure I do not need to explain what d7 is, unless you live under a rock..... lol ;)

To UPGRADE, make sure you follow the directions IN ORDER in the update.txt file.
