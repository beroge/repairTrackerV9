A new release of PC Repair Tracker is attached to this email. This release contains two major new features, support for
the php pear mailing library and multi store support.

Pear Mailer:
############

Not all server hosts allow use of their servers for relaying email. Many hosts do allow it, but have 
firewalls in place or other hoops to jump through in order to allow the relay of email. Pear is something
many hosts include support for. With this new feature you can specify an smtp host with or without
authentication to relay email. Use of the pear library also makes it easier to attach inline images. So if
you use the pear library to send email, it will attach your logo and display it inline on receipts and invoices.
I have tested it with Evolution, Outlook, Windows Mail, and Gmail, and the logo image displays fine. This new
feature will also be great for people that run inhouse servers that have previously been unable to relay mail.
As long as you can get pear installed, you can use and alternate smtp server to send email with a username
and password.

Multi Store Support:
####################

The new multistore support is intended for computer repair shops that operate under the same business name
but have more than one location. It allows you to keep work orders separate on the repair side of PCRT and
track sales and inventory separately on the Point of Sale side of PCRT.

Adding support for this required modifications to almost all of the php files. Before you upgrade as always
it is a good idea to backup your files and database.

####################

Also fairly noteable is there is now a stylesheet for most printables in PCRT, this should help
allow you to tweak fonts and font sizes easier.

You can also now edit items on invoices, basically you use the same function you use to checkout an invoice,
but instead of completing a sale, you can modify the items, and then click the link at the bottom of the
current cart to save the invoice.

Be sure to read and follow the update.txt file for upgrade instructions. Make sure to perform all previous 
upgrades before applying this upgrade.

Make sure you only run the database upgrade script once. The script when run will add your default store
set all your users as well as all work orders, invoices, receipts, stickies, and inventory to the default
store.

Don't forget to refresh the browsers on your clients after upgrading to get the updated stylesheet.

Some of you have asked in the past if you can skip versions, if you wish to try this, you still need to
follow the upgrade instructions for each release, but you can skip the step where you upload all of the 
php files (except for the deps.php file) until the end using the php files from the most current release 
you are upgrading to.

Also I would like to note, there are alot of great feature suggestions in the forums, but the amount
of time it took to add the multi store support I did not want to push this release back any further.

Thank you all for your support and encouragement, it is truly appreciated.
