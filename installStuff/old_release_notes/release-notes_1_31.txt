A new release of PC Repair Tracker is attached to this email. This release contains alot of small enhancements.
Notable new features are a vastly expanded Grouping feature for grouping PC's together under one umbrella, a optional
QR code printed on claim tickets that customers can scan with their smart phone to easily check repair status, also added a clickable link
to repair status on the claim ticket. Also a long requested feature, printed receipts now show the discount applied. Even though it stinks that
android flash and ipods cannot use the cam to directly take asset photos and submit them, there is now a manual asset image upload feature.
Also many people like to have the customers name visable all the time on a work order, so I added a kind of experimental floating bar along
the right side of the page in work order view. It uses the newer CSS transform feature, I made it optional and it can be turned off per user
in the settings menu. I am afraid it may get weird on smaller screen devices. Will keep it in future releases if I get at least a few people
that say they like it.

Be sure to read the update.txt file for upgrade instructions.

Don't forget to refresh the browsers on your clients after upgrading to get the updated stylesheet.
