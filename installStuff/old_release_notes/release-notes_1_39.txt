A new release of PC Repair Tracker is attached to this email.

Whats NEW: 

# Date Localization
You can now setup how you would like your dates to appear, the order as well as the format. 
You can also now translate the month and day of week names. There are a few places you will 
not be able to re-order the date, this is mostly in text boxes where the date has to be used 
in calculations.


# Special Order feature
You can now enter information about special order parts on work orders and view them all in 
one central location.

# Suppliers
You can now define information about suppliers and then tag this information when adding 
inventory items.

# Stock Levels
You can now setup stock level maintenance. It also includes a report for knowing what to re-order. 
You can also request stock recounts so that your techs can double check current stock levels per stock location.

# Expansion of the saved cart feature. It now shows current stock levels, with the option to update
the price if it has changed since the cart was created or saved. Now also a separate area for saving
carts as kits with a control to add kits to a work order.

# Work order maps now also have driving directions.

# Mileage log feature where you can keep track of travel. It will also automatically populate the
mileage value with the distance from the store config address to the customer address.

# Multiple Checkouts - Ability to checkout more than one work order or invoice at one onto the same
receipt.

# Simple Timeclock Feature (Beta)
This is a new feature to PCRT. For now very little integration is in place between the repair tracker and
the timeclock. It has been designed as a stand alone timeclock that can be used for all of your
employees, even those that do not use or have access to the repair tracker.

It can be accessed via any web browser or you could setup a device by a door for employees to punch as
they come and go. The punch clock interface is touch friendly or you can print off employee badges with an 
employee photo and setup a scan gun to scan the badge. Scan guns with a stand that can be screwed to the 
wall run about $25 on ebay. You can also purchase badge holders and retractable lanyards dirt cheap on 
ebay as well. The standard badge size uses the dymo 30374 business card stock. Dymo also makes a 
visitor badge stock, but these are very flimsy and it is hard to find badge holders that fit these.

The timeclock does share the user database with the repair tracker, but has its own admin page, with its
own permissions that can be assigned. If you change a password from the timeclock side, it will change
it for the repair tracking side as well.

When accessing the timeclock for the first time, it will ask for a username and password. After a 
sucessful login, it will add your IP address to the list of places that can access the time clock
punching portion with out a password.
