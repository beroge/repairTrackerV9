A new release of PC Repair Tracker is attached to this email. 
This release contains alot of smaller requested features and other small refinements.

# Footer texts moved to Admin area in Settings:
This was necessary to accomodate thankyou letters but also other footer texts so that you 
can have different versions per store for multistore users.

# Thank You Notes:
You can now email and print thankyou notes. 

#Inventory:
You can now edit previously entered inventory to change a mistyped quantity or alter the 
paid price.

#You are being watched!
For those that use the repair status scripts, PCRT now tracks when and how many times
a customer has checked in on your progress and displays an icon in the status list
when this happens. This will help you give more attention to those customers who
do not seem to have any patience!

#Colors
You can now go into the store admin and set the color of the thin strip and back ground color.
This setting is per store, so that multistore users also have another quick way of identifing 
which store they are currently set to.

#Printing
Most customer printables now have a print bar and also have the links removed from inside the page
for a cleaner appearance.

#Assigning Users
You can now assign a work order to a user and toggle the status list view to show just your
assigned work orders or all work orders like it currently does.

#Signature Pad
Their is now an expiramental Signature pad on the claim ticket. This feature will probably need
more work.

Make sure you follow the directions IN ORDER in the update.txt file.
