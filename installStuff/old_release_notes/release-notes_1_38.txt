A new release of PC Repair Tracker is attached to this email.

Whats NEW: 

# Device Types
You can now define multiple device types, each with their own info fields, and list of asset accessories. 
For those that use d7 several new available fields from the d7 report files have been added and you can
now map these to asset info fields right in the admin control panel.


# Receipt Printer Support
An alternate view for Sales Receipts, Deposit Receipts and Claim Tickets are now available with a narrow template for printing on a thermal 
receipt printer with 80mm paper rolls. If you use this feature be sure to set your paper width properly in the control panel for your receipt printer.

# Scheduled Work Orders:
You can now define a work order as scheduled with a date and time. Also new buttons were added to switch the status list view between in progress
jobs and scheduled jobs.

# Timers
A new timer feature has been added to track billable time on work orders. You can also track time from the POS without a work order. You can then automatically
apply hourly rates against the recorded time and add it directly to a repair cart or POS cart.

#Tax Groups
You can now apply multiple tax rates per item as long as they are defined as part of a tax group. A given tax rate can be applied to an item
as an individual rate or as part of a group rate and the tax report will automatically separate the
taxes by municipality in the tax report. 

#Block of Time
You can now keep track of Block of Time contracts on group contacts. You can apply hours from any PC work order associated with the group to these contracts. 
You can create recurring invoices that add hours to the contract on a recurring basis or manually invoice more hours to the contract. 


To UPGRADE, make sure you follow the directions IN ORDER in the update.txt file.
