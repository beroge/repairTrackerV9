# Messages Feature: 

Alot of work went into the logic of this. The problem is, you don't always know which work order or group a incoming message
pertains to. So on the work orders, it will display messages that match any of the customer phone numbers or email addresses
on the asset or group contact. Another problem, when viewing an older work order with newest messages first, you might see 
messages that are newer that do not pertain to that work order. So on the work orders, it will only show messages 
sent or received within one week prior to the check in date and one week after the checkout date. You can still use 
the "Browse Messages" button to see everything.

The messages browser linked from the main menu or accessed from the new messages notification icon will show potential matches 
to the phone number or email. It will show you groups, assets and work orders that were worked on during the timeframe 
of when the message was received. The notification icon will only show new incoming messages.	

If you use the outbound email feature it will add a line that says "Write your reply above this line". If you use Zapier
to funnel your incoming email it will attempt to strip out the quoted text in the reply. In most cases what you will want
to do is have your generic store config email (like info@ contact@ etc. )be the account to use for this so that personal 
stuff is not mixed in. Or for instance with Gmail you could use a Zapier search to pickup on this line in emails sent from PCRT:

##-## Please reply above this line. ##-##

And only have it Zap those to PCRT.


# The Customer Portal

The customer portal uses the group email address as the login username. It will still work if you have more than one group with the same
email address, it will let the customer switch between group accounts in the main user portal. If a customer does not have a group created, 
but has assets with and email address specified, the first time they attempt to login, it will automatically create a new group and place all
assets that match the email address in that group.

When they register, it will send a temporary password via email to the portal user. If they do not have an email address on a group or asset,
it will not send them and email or tell them that their account was not found. If a user requests a password reset, they will first be sent
an email with a link to click for verification purposes before the password is reset. The new password will be emailed to them.
They can change the password to something different in the portal.

They can pay invoices using Stripe or AuthorizeNet. If there are deposits attached to the invoice, it will show the balance and offer them
to pay just the balance. When paid, it will create a receipt and show as paid in PCRT. It will also mark any deposits attached as applied.

For portal downloads, in the settings menu (after you apply the new user permission) you can upload attachments that will be available to 
all portal users. On any group viewer page you can upload attachments that are only available to that specific group user.

There is also a link in the group viewer to view that customers portal page without having to login. 


Hope you enjoy this release!

Change: The status list in PCRT was designed so that things are always front and center and do not slip through the cracks. I.E. fixme, call me,
        come get me and pay for me.
        There are a few people that never check anything out. I have seen installs with 300+ open work orders. This drastically kills performance. So now statuses
        will display the total number of work orders in a status, but only display the first 12 work orders in a status. This can be overridden with a variable in
        the repair/deps.php file. Also, in the status style editor you can mark a status as a "collapsed" status. The status will still show, but you must click
        a link to see the jobs in the status. This was added for some people that wish to place items in a long term type status but still an open work order.
