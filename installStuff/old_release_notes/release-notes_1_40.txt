A new release of PC Repair Tracker is attached to this email.

Whats NEW: 

# Support for 1X5 topaz signature pads.

# The Big One: A new mobile web option for PCRT. The goal for this new mobile view, besides being more user friendly for mobile devices
is to make sure you can perform most day to day tasks on your mobile device and not be a "second-class" citizen to the desktop version of PCRT.
This is not a native app, but a mobile web version. The hope is that by keeping it a mobile web app, it will be easier to keep devoloping it to 
keep pace with the desktop version.
