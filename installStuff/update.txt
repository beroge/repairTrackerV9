Then copy this file in your repair folder and run it from your browser by entering your system URL in the browser address
bar like "http://myrepairsystem.com/mysystem/repair/databaseupgrade-8to9.php". Click the "Upgrade" link. For this
upgrade script you will need to choose the default terms for your existing invoices.
Once you see the upgrade finished message you are done. Delete the upgrade script from your repair folder when you are finished.
